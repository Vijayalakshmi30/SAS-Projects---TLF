# Clinical Data Reporting: ADaM to Tables & Figures
This repository contains SAS programs for generating clinical trial Tables and Figures from Analysis Data Model (ADaM) datasets. Outputs include key tables and graphs, such as Adverse Events Summary Table by Highest Toxicity NCI-CTCAE grades, Best Overall Response (BOR) Table, Change from Baseline Table, Demographics Table, Kaplan-Meier (KM) Figure, Lab Shift Table, and Progression-Free Survival by Remission Status (PFS) Table. These reports follow CDISC guidelines for clinical data presentation.


## Overview
This project provides SAS programs to create essential clinical trial tables and graphs from ADaM datasets, supporting regulatory submissions and clinical data analysis. Each report is designed according to CDISC standards to ensure consistent, high-quality clinical trial documentation.

The repository includes programs to generate the following tables and figures:
- **AE Table**: Summarizes adverse events
- **BOR Table**: Displays best overall response
- **Change from Baseline Table**: Shows changes in key metrics from baseline
- **Demographics Table**: Provides participant demographic information
- **KM Figure**: Kaplan-Meier survival analysis
- **Lab Shift Table**: Tracks shifts in lab results across visits
- **PFS Table**: Reports progression-free survival

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized by report type, with individual folders containing SAS scripts, sample data, and documentation for each report.

## Project Details

**AE Table:** Provides an overview of adverse events, categorized by severity and relation to treatment.

**BOR Table:** Summarizes the best overall response achieved by participants in the study.

**Change from Baseline Table:** Tracks changes in critical measurements, enabling analysis of treatment impact.

**Demographics Table:** Presents participant demographics, including age, gender, and race.

**KM Figure:** Kaplan-Meier plot for visualizing survival or time-to-event data.

**Lab Shift Table:** Shows lab parameter shifts across visits, highlighting changes in clinical markers.
PFS Table: Reports progression-free survival rates for study participants.
